        <h2><strong>History of Puerto Vallarta </strong></h2>
        <article>
            <p> During the first part of the 19th century, at the mouth of the Cuale River – at that moment in time,
                inhabited mostly by crocodiles – there were practically no human dwellers. Between the rugged Sierra,
                the ocean and the powerful Ameca River, this beautiful piece of Mexican geography remained isolated from
                the rest of the world.​</p>
            <p>The hubs of economic activity were up in the mountains, in the towns of Cuale, San Sebastián, and
                Mascota, where silver mines abounded but where salt, an essential element for the metal processing,
                wasn’t found, we’ll return to that further on. Today, visitors to Puerto Vallarta can enjoy a
                breathtaking view from any of the hills that surround the city.</p>
            <p>
                Puerto Vallarta is located on the Pacific Coast in one of the largest bays in the world (a member of
                “The Most Beautiful Bays in the World Club”.</p>
            Banderas Bay measures 42 kilometers from north to south. The northernmost limit of the bay is at Punta
            Mita which is the end of the Sierra de Vallejo mountains and, to the south, the bay ends in Cabo
            Corrientes, part of the foothills of the Sierra del Cuale range.</p>
            <p>The bay has been known since the XVI Century when Spanish soldiers, during the expeditions to Lower
                California (or the island of pearls, as they called it), landed on the bay’s beaches in order to supply
                their ships with water, firewood, and fresh food. There are many chronicles from that time that mention
                the beauty of the coastline, the fertility of the land and the safe harbors that the bay offered ships.
            </p>
            <p>During the XVI Century, safe harbors all along the Pacific Coast were a vital necessity so that ships
                returning from the Philippines would have a place to find refuge in case of an attack by pirates. These
                harbors were also necessary during the long journeys, to and from the Orient so that ships could be
                repaired if necessary and crews could take on provisions.</p>
            <p>One of the first to propose a settlement on Banderas Bay was Captain Pedro de Unamuno after the trip he
                made in 1587 from the Philippines. Famous navigators like Sebastian Vizcaino, Lopez de Vicuña, and
                Gonzalo de Francia more than once landed on these beaches and also proposed the establishment of a
                colony, but their petitions never received any attention.</p>
            <p>It is known that a shipyard was built on the bay in 1644 (probably where Mismaloya is located today) and
                two ships were built for Bernardo Bernal de Pinadero that would be used in the colonization of Lower
                California.

                In document and in ships logs dating from the XVIII Centuries, constant references are made to whaling
                ships and fishing boast that harbored in the bay. At the time, Banderas Bay was also known as Humpback
                Bay (Bahia de Los Jorobados) because of the number of humpback whales that were seen in the bay.

                In the XIX Century, the site that is today Puerto Vallarta was used for the loading and unloading of
                supplies and materials for the mining companies that worked the mines in Cuale and San Sebastian. At
                that time the site was known as Las Peñas.</p>
